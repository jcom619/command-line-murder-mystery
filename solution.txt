Try poking around what's in a file by using the 'head' command:

  head -n 20 people

This will show you the first 20 lines of the 'people' file.⏎                                                                                                     $ head -n 20 people
head: people: No such file or directory
$ cd mystery/
$ head -n 20 people

To go to the street someone lives on, use the file
for that street name in the 'streets' subdirectory.
To knock on their door and investigate, read the line number
they live on from the file.  If a line looks like gibberish, you're at the wrong house.

Try using grep to search for the clues in the crimescene file:

        grep "CLUE" crimescene

CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is at least 6' tall.

CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, 
    Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. 
    The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.

CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a person left right before they heard the shots. 
    The name on their latte was Annabel, they had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

    -6' tall.

        'Nor I,' said the March Hare.

        Alice sighed wearily. 'I think you might do something better with the
        time,' she said, 'than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'

        'If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, 'you wouldn't talk
        about wasting IT. It's HIM.'

    To see who was a member of several different groups, you can combine their membership lists into one and search against that.
        cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith"

    If you only want to see the number of matches, you can use grep's -c option (the c must be lowercase):
        cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep -c "John Smith"

    Or you can pipe the result to 'wc -l':
        cat Fitness_Galaxy AAA United_MileagePlus | grep "John Smith" | wc -l⏎
